Hello World.  I am considering devoloping a mobile game app, that runs with Cardano;
I am at the early stages of this venture and am in the process of learning what I will need to learn!;
The game idea is sound and simple, but it allows players without a balance to participate as well and produce an income;
I think there is a real posability, because of how simple the idea is, that it could be a very helpful prospect for people in developing nations;

I have been programming for 2 decades, and even published a few small mobile games, and a few dozen games for pc;
My main passion has been to build simulations, algorythms that produce self evolving systems; 
I have thousands of these sorts of programs that I have devoloped over the years.  

I am completly solo at this point, my partner in game devolopment has gone mia for the last year now.  So I hope to find a community or hire some help at some stage.
