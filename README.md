Hello World. I am considering developing a mobile game app that runs with Cardano; I am at the early stages of this venture and am in the process of learning what I will need to learn!; The game idea is sound and simple, it will allow players without a balance to participate as well and produce an income; I think there is a real possibility, because of how simple the idea is, that it could be a very helpful prospect for people in developing nations;
I have been programming for 2 decades, and even published a few small mobile games, and a few dozen games for pc; My main passion has been to build simulations, algorithms that produce self evolving systems; I have thousands of these sorts of programs that I have developed over the years.
I am completely solo at this point, my partner in game development has gone mia for the last year now. So I hope to find a community or hire some help at some stage.
