Hello World.  I am considering devoloping a mobile game app, that runs with Cardano;
I am at the early satges of this venture and am in the process of learning what I will need to learn!;
The game idea is sound and simple, but it allows players without a balance to participate as well and produce an income;
I think there is a real posability, because of how simple the idea is, that it could be a very helpful prospect for people in developing nations;
